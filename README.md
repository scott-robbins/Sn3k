# SN3K
A simple python game (my first with pygame).

After you start the game, a random target will appear on screen, and wiggle around avoiding the snake.
If you capture one, the snake grows by one tile. You will lose if the snake goes off-screen or collides
with itself. The game will keep track of a high score, so you can try and outdo yourself!
